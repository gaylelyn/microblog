  <h2>Getting Used to the Grind</h2>
  <span class="post-date"><em>August 17th, 2025</em></span>
  </div>
  <p>I'm back, although there haven't been much updates lately. I suppose that was the point of writing this. before i graduated, there was nothing much in my life outside of school. 
  and it is starting to become evident that there is also nothing much in my life outside of work. now that i have a full time job, there's a clearer distinction between work and non work hours (compared to school).
  so the my lack of exciting hobbies/interests has become more apparent.</p>
  <p>been trying to get more active these days but it's hard to find time after work but i do my best, and will provide updates. i am my own accountability partner. been also thinking about how i could potentially try my hands at a side hustle
   but i haven't had any mindblowing ideas yet - one that excites me but doesn't consume too much time. my colleague recommends some sort of digital product but idk i can't think of anything.</p>
  <p>anyway, i started using my habit tracker for the lols, this month i am tracking my water and vitamin c consumption and exercise routine (the last is not so successful). here is a currently look at my edc.</p>
  <p><img src="media/edc1.jpg" alt="EDC1" style="width: 35%; height: auto;"> <br>
  left to right: wallet/card holder, gambol b5 notebook for note taking at work ('modded' the notebook with masking tape pen holder), pens (rotring 500, artline highlighter, uniball eye ultra micro, jetstream edge 0.38mm, uni metal lead case), 
   nite ize carabiner, mijia tag tracker, nextool keychain tool, rhodia n11 notebook, zebra mini mechanical pencil, redmi buds 4 pro earbuds, mintia mints, casio f-84w, pixel 8a (with my name emboss label + emi tharsorn <3), muji pouch with plasters, panadol and random emergency stuff.</p>

  <h2>First Month of Employment </h2>
  <span class="post-date"><em>July 27th, 2025</em></span>
  </div>
  <p> Just so you know, promptly after i wrote the last post, my teeth got mildly inflammed again...so hooray to my first week at work while juggling teeth pain..
  got my cavities filled yesterday, thank you to the government CDC vouchers for sponsoring half the cost. </p>
  <p> job wise, things are pretty okay. one month into the job and i'm slowly getting the hang of things. some tasks are a little daunting (alot) but the people there are real friendly.
  one of the main down sides of the job is that it's in the west and i live in the east so its nearly a 2h commute one way...
  really thought i was gonna be one of those people reading a kindle on the train but my brain is just too dead everyday (not a performative male yay). </p>
  <p> to pass time on the train/after work, i've been really into some thai dramas recently, so at least that's something to look forward to. i'm also watching abbott elementary now on the weekdays over dinner, 
  cos the office became abit dry (why is season 6 lowkey all about jim and pam).</p>
  my goal for the month of august is to start a habit tracker. i got inspired by this <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPrymYfmrCU&ab_channel=DominicHart'>video</a>
  and i'm trying to make use of the rhodia n11 writing pad i got from itoya in tokyo, it's abit small but let's see if it works out. </p>

  <h2>Last Days of Unemployment</h2>
  <span class="post-date"><em>June 28th, 2025</em></span>
  </div>
  <p> Happy to announce that my teeth is much better now. only took about 3 weeks, no biggie (<a href='https://i.imgflip.com/3mngao.jpg?a486264'>war flashbacks</a>). </p>
  <p> after my last blog entry, there wasn't really much to update about. i lazed around at home for abit and then went to thailand for a week trip with my friends, food was AWESOME. then i came home and here i am. </p>
  <p> i start my first full time job in a few days. not sure how i feel about it because it's honestly a big change and i'm not really big on changes. the last time there was such a big (medium) transition was when i went to summer school.
  there was alot of uncertainty then but it turned out to be a good experience. im typically a follow the status quo kinda person. but we'll see how this job goes, i gotta find my way into this new work routine. </p>
  <p>i cherish the days of unemployment, although i was pretty bored at times, i think i will look back at this period of time fondly.</p>
  <p> calm before the storm lol? </p>

  <h2>Wisdom Teeth Woes</h2>
  <span class="post-date"><em>June 6th, 2025</em></span>
  </div>
  <p>My tooth absolutely HURTS. to be specific, its the gums around the wisdom tooth, particularly to bottom ones.
  when they first started growing out slightly over 2 years ago, the pain was extruciating as well. that lasted a few weeks till it eventually subsided. 
  the pain comes back every now and then, but nothing too unberable. this was until i went for my bi-annual dental checkup a few days ago and thought that it'll be a good idea to clean my wisdom teeth extra thoroughly
  (the dentist had just informed me that i have THREE cavities....so i was scheduled for a filling appointment in the next month). </p>
  <p>anyway i must have cleaned the wisdom teeth area too hard because it is real swollen and tender right now. i can't open my jaws fully and it hurts to eat...
  i'm real lazy to go back to the dentist especially since i visited just a few days ago, and i don't want to pay for another round of consultation fees.</p>
  <p>my reddit recent posts are filled with concerned posts about wisdom tooth infections. i learnt that you can get pus in your gums. i'm constantly looking at my teeth in the mirror because i'm pretty sure they're infected.
  i guess i'll wait it out unless the pain gets real bad.</p>
  <p>so much for trying to be someone i'm not...i will never be a clean teeth gal.</p>

  <h2>First Blog Post</h2>
  <span class="post-date"><em>June 3rd, 2025</em></span>
  </div>
  <p> I'm attempting to restart my blogging efforts because i'm in between 'jobs' now. i've officially graduated from university and i'm waiting to start my first full time job in a months time.
  for the first time in awhile, i actually have the time to do anything i want to, and yet i find myself not doing much.</p>
  <p> i'm actually pretty bored. i shuttle between instagram, youtube and reddit during my waking hours. i can't commit to a 2h movie (even though i scroll endless youtube shorts in the same amount of time). 
  to combat this, i decided to pick up reading again. i find that i am only able to concentrate on reading in the mornings, before i am exposed to any form of internet media. i am easily distracted. 
  anyway, my current read is Listen by Kathryn Mannix; it's been a pretty useful read so far. </p>
  <p> another few hobbies that i'm hoping to pick up since i don't have to study 24/7 are - learning japanese/french and skateboarding. i hope i have the time to do that even with my full time job.</p>
  <p> so that's that. let's see how long i can sustain this microblog for. hopefully this isn't just another one of my fads.</p>
  <p> also don't come at me for my unorganised code for this website. i'm not sure how to use external libraries or software thingys to organise the tags in my blog. i probably should figure out how to use Jekyll,
  at least gpt is reccommending me to use it. </p>
