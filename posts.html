  <p> I'm attempting to restart my blogging efforts because i'm in between 'jobs' now. i've officially graduated from university and i'm waiting to start my first full time job in a months time.
  for the first time in awhile, i actually have the time to do anything i want to, and yet i find myself not doing much.</p>
  <p> i'm actually pretty bored. i shuttle between instagram, youtube and reddit during my waking hours. i can't commit to a 2h movie (even though i scroll endless youtube shorts in the same amount of time). 
  to combat this, i decided to pick up reading again. i find that i am only able to concentrate on reading in the mornings, before i am exposed to any form of internet media. i am easily distracted. 
  anyway, my current read is Listen by Kathryn Mannix; it's been a pretty useful read so far. </p>
  <p> another few hobbies that i'm hoping to pick up since i don't have to study 24/7 are - learning japanese/french and skateboarding. i hope i have the time to do that even with my full time job.</p>
  <p> so that's that. let's see how long i can sustain this microblog for. hopefully this isn't just another one of my fads.</p>
  <p> also don't come at me for my unorganised code for this website. i'm not sure how to use external libraries or software thingys to organise the tags in my blog. i probably should figure out how to use Jekyll,
  at least gpt is reccommending me to use it. </p>
