  <h2>Wisdom Teeth Woes</h2>
  <span class="post-date"><em>June 6th, 2025</em></span>
  </div>
  <p>My tooth absolutely HURTS. to be specific, its the gums around the wisdom tooth, particularly to bottom ones.
  when they first started growing out slightly over 2 years ago, the pain was extruciating as well. that lasted a few weeks till it eventually subsided. 
  the pain comes back every now and then, but nothing too unberable. this was until i went for my bi-annual dental checkup a few days ago and thought that it'll be a good idea to clean my wisdom teeth extra thoroughly
  (the dentist had just informed me that i have THREE cavities....so i was scheduled for a filling appointment in the next month). </p>
  <p>anyway i must have cleaned the wisdom teeth area too hard because it is real swollen and tender right now. i can't open my jaws fully and it hurts to eat...
  i'm real lazy to go back to the dentist especially since i visited just a few days ago, and i don't want to pay for another round of consultation fees.</p>
  <p>my reddit recent posts are filled with concerned posts about wisdom tooth infections. i learnt that you can get pus in your gums. i'm constantly looking at my teeth in the mirror because i'm pretty sure they're infected.
  i guess i'll wait it out unless the pain gets real bad.</p>
  <p>so much for trying to be someone i'm not...i will never be a clean teeth gal.</p>

  <h2>First Blog Post</h2>
  <span class="post-date"><em>June 3rd, 2025</em></span>
  </div>
  <p> I'm attempting to restart my blogging efforts because i'm in between 'jobs' now. i've officially graduated from university and i'm waiting to start my first full time job in a months time.
  for the first time in awhile, i actually have the time to do anything i want to, and yet i find myself not doing much.</p>
  <p> i'm actually pretty bored. i shuttle between instagram, youtube and reddit during my waking hours. i can't commit to a 2h movie (even though i scroll endless youtube shorts in the same amount of time). 
  to combat this, i decided to pick up reading again. i find that i am only able to concentrate on reading in the mornings, before i am exposed to any form of internet media. i am easily distracted. 
  anyway, my current read is Listen by Kathryn Mannix; it's been a pretty useful read so far. </p>
  <p> another few hobbies that i'm hoping to pick up since i don't have to study 24/7 are - learning japanese/french and skateboarding. i hope i have the time to do that even with my full time job.</p>
  <p> so that's that. let's see how long i can sustain this microblog for. hopefully this isn't just another one of my fads.</p>
  <p> also don't come at me for my unorganised code for this website. i'm not sure how to use external libraries or software thingys to organise the tags in my blog. i probably should figure out how to use Jekyll,
  at least gpt is reccommending me to use it. </p>
